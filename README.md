# City School Comparisons

## Background 
This data analysis provides an overview of 15 schools within a particular district and breaks down the data to take a closer look at the contributing factors to differences in students’ scores in math and reading, the percentage of students passing math and reading, and the percentage of students passing overall. Using student outcome data along with information about each schools’ budget, type, and size, we can evaluate the factors that lead to increased student success to make decisions to improve student outcomes within the district. 

Analysis of student outcomes across 15 schools broken down into: 
- Top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rate. 
- Math and reading by grade breaks down the average scores in math each grade level for each school. 
- Scores by school spending breaks down school performances based on average spending ranges per student 
- Average overall math and reading scores across schools 
- Math and reading scores by school size
- Math and reading scores by school type

## Summary

At first glance, it appears that schools with larger per student budgets have the lowest overall passing rates. However, if we compare the per-student budget to the total number of students we can see that they are directly proportional, suggesting that schools with a larger student body have lower student outcomes. To better see this trend, we can observe that the overall passing rate in charter schools (90.4%) is significant higher than district schools (53.7%) and charter schools have a significantly smaller student body. This can also be seen in the breakdown of spending ranges, with the lower bracket of spending per student between $550-$599, all of which are charter schools, have a higher overall passing rate in comparison to schools with higher spending per student.
