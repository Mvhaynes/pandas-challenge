This script provides an overview of key metrics about each school within the district. 


Top Performing Schools highlights the top 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate. 

Bottom Performing Schools highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate. 

Math Scores by Grade breaks down the average scores in math each grade level for each school. 

Reading Scores by Grade breaks down the average scores in reading across each grade level for each school. 


Scores by School Spending breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student) by three spending brackets. 

Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)




Scores by School Size

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).


Scores by School Type

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

As final considerations:

Use the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.
You must submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook.
You must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.
See Example Solution for a reference on the expected format.
